Hi, my name is Oliver Gonzalez. I'm a 21-year-old novice programmer based out of the Rio Grande Valley in Texas. I have no experience working as a
programmer or developer for any organizations or companies... yet. This is where I upload the projects I've made that I'm most proud of. I also 
write my own music.
